## Outline
- Reading files: Excel and .csv


## Importing Data

We often need to import our own data rather than just using built-in datasets. The following steps are usually taken:

- First we need to tell R where the data is saved using `setwd()`.
- Data is then read in using R functions such as:
    - `read.table()` for reading in .txt files
    - `read.csv()` for reading in .csv files
- Assign the data to a new R object when reading in the file.

## Importing Data Demo

We first create a .csv file. We can use a text editor, excel, etc. Then we load the file in:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd(/pathtodirectory)
```
```{r}
crypto_art <- read.csv("crypto_art_pulse.csv")
```

## Data in Excel
Excel has file formats such as xls and csv - so what are the differences? File extensions .xls or .xlsx are proprietary Excel formats, they are binary files. .csv is the extension for comma separated value files. They are text files - and are directly readable.

## Reading Files in R

Text files, usually comma separated or tabular separated (space) can both be read in with `read.csv()`

```{r,eval = F}
read.csv(file, header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "\\"",
 dec = ".", fill = TRUE, comment.char = "", ...)
```
For a comma separated file, we set `sep = ","` otherwise, for a tabular separated file we use `sep = ""`.

## Reading .csv Files

```{r}
Punks <- read.csv("punks.csv")
head(Punks)
```

---

```{r}
str(Punks)
```

---

## Reading Excel Files
We need to install another package to read excel files: `readxl`

```{r,eval =F}
install.packages(readxl)
```

```{r}
library(readxl)

Punks2 <- read_excel("punks.xlsx",sheet = 1)
head(Punks2)

```

## Your Turn
Using the crypto_art_pulse.csv file, do the following:

1. Read the data into an object called crypto_art.

2. Use the `head()` function to display some rows.

3. Use the `str()` function to see each variable type.

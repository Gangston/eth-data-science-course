## Loading CryptoPunks Data set
This data set displays the sales of CryptoPunks since June 23rd, 2017 to December 30th, 2020.


```{r}
Punks <- read.csv("punks.csv")
names(Punks) # See all column names
```

---

## First 6 Rows

Recall that `head()` displays the first 6 rows of our data.
```{r}
head(Punks)
```

---

## Some Computations

### Addition and Subtraction
How much more did Punk 3830 last sell for compared to Punk 1 in ETH?
```{r}
99.99-60.00
```

--

### Multiplication/Division
What is the average sale price in ETH for Punk 0?
```{r}
(0.98+1.6+25)/3
```

---

## More Calculator Operations

```{r}
# Integer division
82 %/% 10

# Modulo operator (Remainder)
82 %% 10

# Powers
8^3
```

---

## Even More Functions

- Exponentiation
  * `exp(x)`

- Logarithms
  * `log(x)`
  * `log(x, base = 10)`

- Trigonometric functions
  * `sin(x)`
  * `asin(x)`
  * `cos(x)`
  * `tan(x)`

---

## Creating Variables

We can create variables using the assignment operator `<-`:

```{r}
alien.punk <- 13
```

We can then perform any of the functions on the variables:

```{r}
# Logarithm
log(alien.punk)
# Square root
sqrt(alien.punk)
# Square
alien.punk^2
```

---

## Rules for Variable Creation

- Variable names can't start with a number.
- Variables in R are case-sensitive.
- Some common letters are used internally by R and should be avoided as variable names:
  * c, q, t, C, D, F, T, I
- There are reserved words that R won't let you use for variable names:
  * for, in, while, if, else, repeat, break, next
- R will let you use the name of a predefined function. Try not to overwrite those though!

## Vectors

A variable does not need to be a single value. We can create a **vector** using the `c()` (combine) function:

What are the top 5 highest sales in ETH?

```{r}
y <- c(189.99, 185, 150, 140, 100)  # Creates a vector of top 5 highest sales
```

Operations will then be done element-wise. For example, we can divide the vector by 5:

```{r}
y / 5
```

---

## Getting Help

We will talk MUCH more about vectors later, but for now, let's talk about a couple ways to get help. The primary function to use is the `help` function. Just pass in the name of the function you need help with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(head)
```

The `?` function also works:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?head
```

Googling for help is a bit difficult. You may need to search for R + CRAN + (your query) to get good results.

## R Reference Card

You can download and an R reference card from:

http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf

Having this open or printed off and near you while working is helpful until you master the basics.

---

## Your Turn

Using the R Reference Card (and the Help pages, if needed), do the following:

1. Find out how many rows and columns the CryptoPunks data set has using at least 2 methods.
2. Create a vector with the top 5 sales in ETH.

## Answers

### 1.
```{r}
dim(Punks) # Finds dimension of data frame

str(Punks) # Finds structure of data
```

---

### 2.
```{r}
top5 <- c(3,3,4,2,0) # Vector of top5
```

---

## Some Useful Functions

There are a whole variety of useful functions to operate on vectors. A couple of the more common ones are `length()`, which returns the length (number of elements) of a vector, and `sum()`, which adds up all the elements of a vector.

```{r}
length(top5) # calculates the length of this vector
sum(top5) # Calculates the sum of the vector elements
```

---

## Data Frames Introduction

- `Punks` is a data frame.
- Data frames hold data sets.
- Not every column needs be the same type - like an Excel spreadsheet.
- Each column in a data frame is a vector - so each column needs to have values that are all the same type.
- We can access different columns using the `$` operator.

```{r}
type <- Punks$Type # Creates column named type
skin <- Punks$Skin # Creates column named skin
slots <- Punks$Slots # Creates column named slots
```

---

## More about Vectors

A vector is a list of values that are all the same type. We have seen that we can create them using the `c()` or the `rep()` function. We can also use the `:` operator if we wish to create consecutive values:

```{r}
a <- 10:15
a
```

We can extract the specific elements of the vector as follows:

```{r}
type[3] # Selects the 3rd type in the type column
```

---

## Indexing Vectors

We saw that we can access individual elements of the vector. But **indexing** is a lot more powerful than that:

```{r}
head(type)

type[c(1, 3, 5)] # Selects the 1st, 3rd, and 5th type
```

```{r}
type[1:6] # Selects the 1st through 6th type
```

---

## Logical Statements

- R has built in support for logical statements.
- TRUE and FALSE are built in.  T (for TRUE) and F (for FALSE) are supported but can be modified.
- Logical statements can result from a comparison using:
    - $<$
    - $>$
    - $<=$
    - $>=$
    - $==$
    - $!=$

---

## Indexing with Logical Statements

We can index vectors using logical statements as well:
```{r}

x <- slots[1:5] #Pulls the first 5 slots
x > 3 # Returns which of the first 5 slots are greater than 3
x[x < 3] # returns which is less than 3
```

---

## Logical Examples

In this example, we gather the ID of Alien Type Punks.

```{r}
alien_ID <- (Punks$ID[Punks$Type == "Alien"])
# creates variable, alien_ID, the ID of Punks that are Alien Type
str(alien_ID)
```

We see which IDs are less than 5000 to find certain punks which are labeled `little`.
```{r}
little <- alien_ID < 5000 # Finds punks with an ID of less than 5000
alien_ID[little]
```

---

This code locates the Punks ID that correspond to those slots.
```{r}
(Punks$ID[little][Punks$Type == "Alien"])
```

---

## Element-wise Logical Operators

- `&` (elementwise AND)
- `|` (elementwise OR)

```{r}
c(T, T, F, F) & c(T, F, T, F)
c(T, T, F, F) | c(T, F, T, F)
```

---

## Your Turn

1. When was **Punk 9976** last sold? Note: There are many ways to answer this. Some are faster than others.

2. Find out the number of sales in the Punks data.

**Challenge**: Among all the sales, how many of the sales are more than or equal to 1.00 ETH? Hint(You will need to use <b> 2. </b>.)

## Answers

### 1
```{r}
Punks$Txn[Punks$ID == 9976 & Punks$Transaction == "Sold"][1]
```

### 2.
```{r}
sold <- Punks$Transaction == "Sold"
sum(sold)
```

---

### **Challenge**

```{r}
# Finds the transactions that are more than 1 ETH
sales_1_ETH <- Punks$Crypto[sold] >= 1.00
sum(sales_1_ETH)
```

---

## Modifying Vectors

We can modify vectors using indexing as well. Here we create a new data frame that consists of the first 5 columns of the Punks data set.

```{r}
x <- Punks[1:5]
head(x)
```

---

We can replace all the `Claimed` with `Free` by the following:

```{r}
x[1][x[1] == "Claimed"] <- "Free"
head(x)
```

---

## Data Types in R

- You can use `mode()` or `class()` to find information about variables.
- `str()` is useful to find information about the structure of your data.
- There are many data types but numeric, integer, character, date, and factor are most common.

```{r}
str(Punks)
```

---

## Vector Elements

Elements of a vector must all be the same type.

```{r}
claims <- Punks$Transaction == "Claimed"
head(claims)
str(claims)
claims[claims == "FALSE"] <- ":-(" #Replacing FALSE with a frownie face.
head(claims)
str(claims)
```

By changing one value to character, all values are now character types instead of logical types.

---

## Converting Between Types

We can convert between different types using the `as` series of functions:

```{r}
ids <- head(Punks$ID) # Creates vector of first 6 rows
ids
as.character(ids) # Converts to character
as.numeric("2")
```
Notice that in one instance there are quotation marks and in the other there is not. ids is being converted from a numeric type to a character, while "2" is a character being converted to a numeric type.

---

## Statistical Functions

Using the basic functions we have learned, it would not be difficult to compute some basic statistics.

```{r}
(n <- length(slots)) # Assigns n to be the number of elements in slots
(meanslots <- sum(slots)/n) # Calculates mean by usual formula
(standdev <- sqrt(sum((slots - meanslots)^2) / (n - 1))) # Calculates standard deviation by usual formula
```

This is fairly easy, that is, if you know the formulae!

---

## Built-in Statistical Functions
We don't need to memorize every formula. R does the work for us!
```{r}
mean(slots) # Calculates mean
sd(slots) # Calculates standard deviation
summary(slots) # calculates number summary
quantile(slots, c(.025, .975)) # 2.5% and 97.5% quartiles
```

---

Which Punk has sold more than 20.00 ETH and has 1 slot?
```{r}
condition <- which(Punks$Crypto > 20.00 & Punks$Slots == 1)
Punks[condition,]
```

Just Punk 1963, 3105, 5426, 5944, 9909!

---

## Your Turn

1. Determine which Punk has sold for more than 100 ETH or has 7 slots.
2. Which Punk was sold first? Punk 1111 or Punk 3773?

## Answers

### 1.
```{r}
condition <- which(Punks$Crypto > 100 | Punks$Slots == 7)
Punks[condition,][!duplicated(Punks[condition,]$ID),] #Note !duplicated means NOT duplicated
```

---

### 2.

```{r}
Punk1111 <- Punks$Txn[which(Punks$ID == 1111 & Punks$Transaction == "Sold")]
Punk3773 <- Punks$Txn[which(Punks$ID == 3773 & Punks$Transaction == "Sold")]

Punk1111[length(Punk1111)] #Get the last value in the vector using the length() function
Punk3773[length(Punk3773)]

#We can also compare the dates using logic

Punk1111[length(Punk1111)] < Punk3773[length(Punk3773)]
```
Thus, Punk 3773 was first sold before Punk 1111.

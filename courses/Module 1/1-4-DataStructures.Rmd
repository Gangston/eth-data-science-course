## Data Frames

- Data frames are the work horse of R objects.
- They are structured by rows and columns and can be indexed.
- Each column is a specified variable type.
- Column names can be used to index a variable.
- Advice for naming variables, stated earlier in the course, applies to editing column names.
- Can be specified by grouping vectors of equal length as columns.

## Data Frame Indexing

- Elements indexed similar to a vector using `[` `]`.
- `df[i,j]` will select the element in the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column.
- `df[ ,j]` will select the entire $j^{th}$ column and treat it as a vector.
- `df[i ,]` will select the entire $i^{th}$ row and treat it as a vector.
- Logical vectors can be used in place of i and j to subset the row and columns.

--

## Adding a New Variable to a Data Frame

- Create a new vector that is the same length as other columns.
- Append the new column to the data frame using the `$` operator.
- The new data frame column will adopt the name of the vector.

---

## Data Frame Demo

Loading the previously used Punks data set:

```{r}
Punks <- read.csv("punks.csv")
```

Select the date column (6th column):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Punks[,6]
```

Select the date and skin columns (6th and 10th columns):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Punks[,c(6,10)]
```

---

## Demo (Continued)

Select the ID column with the `$` operator:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Punks$ID
```

We now determine the row location in our data where the ID is 9126.
```{r}
punk_9126 <- Punks$ID == 9126 # Creates vector of T/F values if the entry is 9126.
head(punk_9126)
```
This output doesn't show much. It would be much easier if we could see which positions are `TRUE`!
```{r}
which(punk_9126 == TRUE) # Tells row number where the ID is 9126
```

---

## Demo (Continued)
Displaying part of the Punks data set where the ID is 9998 by subsetting rows.
```{r}
Punks[Punks$ID == 9126, ] #or Punks[punk_9126, ]
```

---

## Creating our own Data Frame

Creating our own data frame using the `data.frame()` function:

```{r}
mydf <- data.frame(NUMS = 1:5,
                   LETS = letters[1:5],
                   PUNK_TYPES = c("Male", "Female", "Alien", "Ape", "Zombie"))
mydf
```
Note that in a data frame, each column has to have the same length!

---

## Renaming columns

We can use the `names()` function to set that first column to lowercase:

```{r}
names(mydf)[1] <- "nums" # Changes the names of the first column in mydf
mydf
```

---
## Renaming columns (Continued)
We can also rename all the columns at once using the `colnames()` command.

```{r}
colnames(mydf) <- c("numbers","letters","punk_types") # Changes all columns at once
mydf
```

---

## Your Turn

1. Construct a data frame where column 1 contains any 5 Punks and column 2 is their Slot number.
2. Select only the rows where the Slot number is even.
3. Determine which rows of the Punks data set contains the Alien Type.

## Answers

### 1.

```{r}
mydf <- data.frame(Punk = c(0,1,2,3,4),
                   Slot = c(3,2,1,3,4)
                   )
mydf
```

---

### 2.

```{r}
mydf[c(2,5),]
```

--

### 3.
```{r}
alien <- Punks$Type == "Alien"
which(alien == TRUE)
```

---

## Lists

- Lists are a structured collection of R objects.
- R objects in a list do not need to be the same type.
- Create lists using the `list` function.
- Lists are indexed using double square brackets `[[ ]]` to select an object.

---
## List Example

Creating a list containing a matrix of size 2 by 5, and a vector of length 5, and a string:

```{r}
mylist <- list(matrix(letters[1:10], nrow = 2, ncol = 5),
               c("Alien", "Ape", "Female", "Male", "Zombie"),
               "CryptoPunks are awesome!")
mylist
```

---
## List Example (Continued)
Note that unlike data frames, lists can contain elements of varying sizes and structures.

Use indexing to select the second list element:
```{r}
mylist[[3]] # Selections third argument in mylist
```

---

## Your Turn

1. Create a list containing `mydf` as well as a vector of length 7 containing different Punk Skins.
2. Use indexing to select mydf from your list.

## Answers

### 1.
```{r}
mylist <- list(mydf,
               c("Albino","Alien","Ape","Dark","Light", "Mid", "Zombie"))
```

--

### 2.
```{r}
mylist[[1]]
```

## Examining Objects

- `head(x)` - View top 6 rows of a data frame
- `tail(x)` - View bottom 6 rows of a data frame
- `summary(x)` - Summary statistics   
- `str(x)` - View structure of object  
- `dim(x)` - View dimensions of object
- `length(x)` - Returns the length of a vector

---

## Examining Objects Demo

We can examine the first two values of an object by passing the `n` parameter to the `head()` function:

```{r}
head(Punks, n = 2) # n = 2 displays only the first two rows.
```

---
## Examining Objects Demo (Continued)
What is Punks structure?

```{r}
str(Punks)
```

---

## Your Turn

1. View the last 4 rows of the Punks data set.
2. How many rows are in Punks data set? (try finding this using dim or indexing + length).

### 1.
```{r}
tail(Punks, n=4)
```

### 2.

```{r}
dim(Punks)
dim(Punks)[1] #Picks first output element
```

## Working with Output from a Function

- You can save the output from a function as an object.
- An object is generally a list of output objects.
- You can extract items from the output for further computing.
- Examine objects using functions like `str()`.

--

## Saving Output Demo

- Apply a t-test using the Punks data set to see if the Sale Price in Crypto for punks with 1 slot and 7 slots are statistically different
- `t.test()` can only handle two groups, so we use a subset of the other slots.

---

## Demo (Continued)

Save the output of the t-test to an object:

```{r}
tout <- t.test(Crypto ~ Slots, data = Punks[Punks$Slots %in% c(1,7), ])
tout
```
An interpretation of this is that there is not a statistical difference in the average sale price in Crypto between the 1 and 7 slot Punks.

---

Let's look at the structure of this object:

```{r}
str(tout)
```

---

## Demo: Extracting the P-Value

Since this is simply a list, we can use our regular indexing:

```{r}
tout$p.value
tout[[3]]
```

---

## Your Turn

1. Return the p-value from t.test comparing the difference between Sale Price in USD from the 2 and 4 Slots.
2. What does this p-value imply?

<p align="center">

<img src="images/Cut_outs/Cut_out_09.png"  width="200px" height="200px">

</p>
---

## Answer

### 1.
```{r}
tout <- t.test(USD ~ Slots, data = Punks[Punks$Slots %in% c(2,4), ])
tout
```

---

### 2.
Since p = 0.5839 > 0.05, there is no significant difference in the means of the two groups. From this we can claim that the Punks with 2 slots and 4 slots were sold at similar price.

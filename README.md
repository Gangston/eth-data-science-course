# Learning Data Science on the Ethereum Blockchain with [@OmniAnalytics](https://twitter.com/OmniAnalytics)

Help us share our joy of data science with the Ethereum eco-system through an informative set of online courses and case studies that merge data analysis, blockchain analytics and statistical programming.

We aspire to create a modular online course to help new software developers understand the principles and best practice of data science. Using open data sources from across the Ethereum landscape (think stateofthedapps, uniswap, etherescan and the Ethereum blockchain itself) the course will teach topics of data munging, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and dabble in a bit of deep learning and artificial intelligence. Spread across three individual modules, the course will focus first on data fundamentals, then move into advanced topics, and if the funding is generous, weâ€™ll create focused case studies on how to use

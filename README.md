## Description

We want to share our joy of data science with the Ethereum eco-system through an informative set of online courses and case studies that merge data analysis, blockchain analytics and statistical programming.

We aspire to create a modular online course to help new blockchain developers understand the principles and best practices of data science. Using open data sources from across the Ethereum landscape (think StateoftheDApps, UniSwap, & Etherscan), the course will teach the topics of data munging, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and dabble in a bit of deep learning and artificial intelligence.  As the course grows, we intend to create case studies around how to apply data science to specific DApps (think machine learning techniques for predicting markets with Numer.ai data or analyzing traits in CryptoKitties).

Our ultimate vision is to spur and inspire the next generation of developers through interesting applications of data science to emerging blockchain technologies.

## Tentative Course Outline

Module 1 - Basic Data Structures and Munging  
Module 2 - Statistical Graphics and Visualization  
Module 3 - Machine Learning and Clustering  
Module 4 - Case Studies  

## FAQ

*Do you all have experience in this stuff?*  
Why yes, we do! Omni Analytics Group is a team of PhD level statistical consultants that have been teaching and solving difficult data science problems for nearly a decade. We are passionate about data science and blockchain technologies. Just check out [our twitter](https://twitter.com/OmniAnalytics).

*Do I need any prior experience before taking this course?*  
Our intention is to start from the beginning and build up not only your data chops, but your statistical intuition and programming knowledge. At the end of these courses, you should be able to match a statistical technique to a blockchain data problem, write a basic script to analyze it and confidently search online for more advanced knowledge.

*What programming languages will the course focus on?*  
We'll initially focus on the statistical language R, but then expand to Python. As the course grows, we hope to include examples with contracts written in Solidity.

*Can I request a topic?*  
Sure! Once we flesh out the initial course material. If funding persists, we'd be more than happy to take suggestions on case studies or topics.

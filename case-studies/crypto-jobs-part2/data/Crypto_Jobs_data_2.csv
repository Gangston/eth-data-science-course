In brief, Bumper protects the value of your crypto using a radically innovative DeFi protocol. Set the price you want to protect and if the market crashes, your asset will never fall below that price. Importantly, if the market pumps, your asset rises too. Pretty impressive huh?
We’ve seen huge interest in our protocol from both investors and prospective users and we're building the system ready for launch in June 2021. But before then we need to grow our community and shout about how seriously impressive this tech is. 
Ideally you're someone who already lives and breathes DeFi. You're already part of relevant communities and possess the social media skills to keep our channels living and breathing our brand.
YOUR ROLE
- Develop a strategic content calendar
- Post regular(daily) engaging content/memes
- Engage in social media conversations
- Identify target groups and communities to engage with
- Actively engage on Discord, Twitter, Telegram and Reddit
- Organize community AMA’s
- Generate monthly social media reports
- Work with external suppliers such as copywriters and agencies
- Write and create engaging content
- This is a flexible remote role
WHO YOU ARE
- Fluent / Native English
- Self-motivated
- Detail-oriented and organized
- Excellent copywriter / storyteller
- Have past experiences in social media management, especially within Twitter, Discord and Telegram
- Have been working in Crypto for more than 2 years, or are very active in your spare time
- Deep knowledge of DeFi ecosystem
- Ideally have your own presence within the crypto community and existing networks 
- Always ready to reply
- Available during UK working hours
WHO WE ARE
INDX Group is an innovative creator of decentralised financial (DeFi) solutions for a new tokenized world. 
Following our successful 2019 STO for Artemis, the masternode investment fund, we’re now bringing our new product, Bumper, to market.
Bumper is a DeFi price protection protocol built on Ethereum, created by INDX and the company that designed Havven (which independently evolved into Synthetix)
Bumper protects the price of crypto assets (ETH at launch) by providing a decentralised software facility for ‘Takers’ of protection to operate diametrically to ‘Makers’ of liquidity. Protected positions incur a floating daily premium, nominally 3% p.a, that is used to incentivise stablecoin depositors into a risk-free liquidity Reserve. 
The Bumper protocol is a pure, decentralised market for on-chain asset price risk, which is transferred from a stablecoin Reserve through to cascading redundancy modules. At any point in time the Reserve has a measurable aggregate liability representing all positions. Should the liability exceed parameterized safety levels, the protocol rebalances, firstly by utilising first order dynamics, such as Premium/ Yield curves/ BUMP distributions and then by opening up to arbitrageur bots and if necessary DEX’s. A separate risk pool, attracting a higher yield tranche, acts to backstop any realized losses caused by sharp volatility. 
Conclusively, these redundancy measures make Bumper a highly productive tool to achieve efficient risk transfer pricing via liability pooling.","Social, Community Building, Discord, Reddit, Creative, Copywriting, DeFi","

Chainflip is like nothing you will have ever worked on before: it is a multidisciplinary exercise in distributed systems, decentralised finance, blockchain consensus mechanisms, cyber security, applied cryptography, and front end tooling.
If any of the below tasks seem appealing to you, read on:
Social Media Management (Killing it on Twitter)
Community Management (Hanging out on Telegram)
Content Writing (Reading and writing about Crypto)
Digital Design (Making pretty things and memes)
Market Analysis (Staying on top of crypto trends)
We want our marketing team to be dynamic and to be able to wear many different hats. If you don;t like the sound of typical roles that attempt to shoehorn your talents into one particular direction, look no further: this is a unique project with massive upside potential and a company with experienced founders and great culture.
The Project
Chainflip enables cross-chain cryptocurrency swapping - like swapping Bitcoin for Ethereum - without using centralised exchanges, specialised wallets, or wrapped tokens. Think of it like Uniswap, but you will always receive the native token.
Existing decentralised token swapping solutions suffer from a range of issues that severely limit usability, privacy, and practicality. Utilising a novel MPC and threshold encryption based system run by its own validator network, Chainflip is a protocol for automated cross-chain token swaps that resolves these issues with a truly decentralised solution.
We are scaling up our experienced team. We’re looking for people who are looking to be a part of a fast growing startup, run by experienced founders and with a solid engineering team and support staff base to help us carry forward the vision we have for the future of permissionless value transfer.
We’ve spent over 9 months working on the product already, which to date has been developed by our team of experienced engineers that have been working with each other for some years already on other projects as well. As we get closer to launch, we need the help of even more talented people to get to launch and go to market from day one. As we said: Chainflip is like nothing you’ll have ever worked on before. This is a very rare opportunity to work in the crypto industry on a project that goes far beyond your typical project or company.
If you’re ambitious, experienced, and/or passionate about DeFi we want to hear from you.
The Role
As an early member of the Chainflip team you will have the opportunity to grow within the business and propel your career in an industry that can truly change how we view self-sovereignty and transfer of value.
As such, we are looking for a passionate cryptocurrency professional that is able to stay on top of trends within the ecosystem, and create highly engaging social media content and activity.
We need someone that can conduct in-depth research into technical, community, and general market trends - someone that can see how our product and project fits within it, and can use this information to make our channels and community platforms pop. Our marketing team needs to be able to jump between tasks and use an array of skills to do what is required as it is required.
Chainflip is a rapidly evolving organisation so being a self starter is essential, we work well as a cohesive team but understanding the nuances of a cryptocurrency startup will be a huge bonus.
Ideally you are already embedded in the DeFi space, maybe you write a blog or are currently a content writer or analyst for a fund, exchange, or project team. If you spend much of your day on Twitter, Medium, and Discord, we want to hear from you. We’re open to applications. Fluent written English is essential though.
Salary range is €36k - 58k, plus equity/tokens
The Process
Please submit your CV and some examples of your writing for review. If we like what we see then you will have an interview with our operations team followed by a final stage with our founder. We reserve the right to add a further stage so you can meet some more of the team.
We have just closed our third funding round so we can move quickly for the right person.

We are also the original developers behind Flow, a new decentralized blockchain and cryptocurrency designed from the ground up for scalability and ease of use.
Our mission at Dapper Labs is to make the world a more open, empowering, and enjoyable place through consumer adoption of decentralized technologies. We have raised over $50M from leading VCs including Fred Wilson (USV) and Chris Dixon as well as Venrock, Samsung, Google Ventures, NBA players, and global artists, among others. Dapper Labs partners include the NBA and NBPA, the NFL-PA, Ubisoft, Warner Music, Turner, Dr. Seuss, Genies, and the UFC, as well as 100+ others.
**Jobs to be done**
- Memorialize the story of Dapper Labs – our people, past work, and vision for the years ahead – working directly with Roham (CEO), Dieter (CTO), and the rest of the leadership team.
- Own the company announcements calendar, working with product, marketing, and creative leaders to craft narratives and quarterback long-form content (press releases, blog posts, op-eds, creative campaigns) across our product portfolio.
- Serve as editor in chief for communications across the organization, helping establish lightweight brand voice and guidelines for each team.
- Co-develop “thought leadership” content with company leaders around areas of our unique expertise: user experience, the potential improvements crypto can bring to everyday consumer products, the opportunities unlocked by blockchain to remake entire industries, the role of open economies in games, the importance of mission-driven businesses, internal cultural principles, etc.
**About Flow**
Flow is a new smart contract blockchain built from the ground up for performance and developer experience – without compromising on decentralization. Instead of networks like Ethereum, where every node in the network performs the same work equally, the Flow architecture allows nodes to specialize based on their hardware capacity as well as their financial stake – dramatically increasing performance while maintaining wide participation.
Compared to sharding, the Flow architecture means the separation of labor between nodes is vertical (across the different validation stages for each transaction) rather than horizontal (across different transactions). In other words, every node still participates in the validation of every transaction, but they do so only at one of the stages of validation. The result is that Flow is the first decentralized network that can maintain a developer friendly, ACID-compliant execution environment at scale. This is critical for composability: https://a16z.com/2018/12/16/4-eras-of-blockchain-computing-degrees-of-composability
**More about Dapper Labs**
Dapper team members are humble and curious builders who share a passion to make the world a more open and empowering place through adoption of decentralized systems. Our people are our greatest strength: our diverse crew flourishes in a distributed hierarchy where personal autonomy and professional growth are encouraged. We value our culture above else: regardless of where you came from, what you studied, or who you used to work for, your role here will necessitate both a high level of creativity and strategic thinking on complex issues.
We recruit the best and foster an environment that empowers our team. That means a workplace that is diverse, inclusive, and open-minded. We welcome applicants of all backgrounds, regardless of race, colour, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, or disability.

Gamers spent more than $100 billion on in-game items last year. However, until now, games have only sold licenses for these in-game items with highly restricted rights. At Immutable, we’re all about ownership: we use blockchain technology to give players true and “immutable” ownership over the items they’ve worked so hard to acquire. 
However, blockchain assets right now are highly illiquid: transactions take minutes or hours to confirm, Ethereum can process fewer than 5 asset trades per second for the whole world combined, and the UX is very challenging for mainstream users. To solve this problem for ourselves and for others, we have built Immutable X, a next-generation protocol for trading blockchain assets with instant trade confirmation and massive scalability without compromising user custody. 
We are opening Immutable X to other developers, and are looking to market it successfully to help as many developers as possible scale their businesses.
The Role
We are looking for a talented Marketing Lead to supercharge this growth by creating a marketing vision and strategy for Immutable X, then executing that strategy. Ideally, you will be a strong marketing generalist - you will have to write public communications, manage key influencer relationships and build a strong social presence. You’ll be able to prioritise the most effective marketing tools to achieve your overall goals.
You’ll have direct accountability for our growth numbers and will be responsible for delivering ambitious targets that drive our revenue strategy. You’ll also own the end-to-end execution for generating inbound opportunities for our Business Development team. 
There is tremendous growth potential in this role and you may be asked to take on additional management responsibilities within this team over time.
A Bit About You
- 3-4 years marketing in a SaaS business or tech startup (mix of B2C and B2B with a focus on B2C)
- 2+ years as a lead where you have defined and executed a marketing strategy
- Strong generalist across PR, events, research, content creation, storytelling, product marketing, digital, marketing automation, growth or product marketing
- Consistent track record of driving full funnel, multi-channel marketing programs
Data-driven leader who can take risks, predict outcomes and analyse results for continuous improvements
- Experience planning and implementing PR strategies including press releases, briefings, scripts and strategies
- Excellent influencing and presenting skills, with the ability to convince the utility of Immutable X in both written and spoken communication
- A proven track record in enabling and accelerating sales teams
- Independent worker with a growth mindset and the ability to achieve results
Some extra skills/interests that would be awesome
- Experience in gaming and/or blockchain
- Connections in the relevant industries
Some of the things we can offer you
- Competitive salary, plus equity
- Relocation package
- Flexibility to work from home regularly
- Located near Central Station in Surry Hills with a rooftop
- Regular, fun social events where we can relax and connect with our teammates

Salary range: €30k - 50k + equity/tokens. Berlin preferred, remote considered. Relocation also possible.
**Description**
Chainflip enables direct cross-chain cryptocurrency swapping - for example Bitcoin for Ethereum - without using centralised exchanges, specialised wallets, or wrapped tokens.
Existing decentralised token swapping solutions suffer from a range of issues that severely limit usability, privacy, and practicality. Utilising a system of distributed Validators, Chainflip takes the simple AMM concept and allows it to happen cross-chain, without sacrificing decentralisation or usability. With several blockchain ecosystems appearing at once, the team that can solve this problem will have built core infrastructure used in the industry for years to come.
Users enter their receiving address, send coins to the automatically-generated deposit address, and that's it. It's like Shapeshift 1.0 without any of the counter-party risk.
We’ve spent over 9 months working on the product already, which to date has been developed by our team of experienced engineers that have been working with each other for some years already on other projects as well. The team will be dramatically expanded over the next 6 months, and we’re looking for people who want to be a part of a fast-growing early-stage team. 
You’ll be joining experienced founders along with an existing team. We’re an early stage venture but we already have momentum, funding ($4m+) and most importantly, a plan.
**The Role**
We're looking for a graphic designer that is able to help with various challenges that pop up during this exciting phase of establishing our company. 
Tasks include:
- Communicative designs which will be used on channels like twitter, telegram and reddit as well as internally (or) for our investors. 
- Conception, design and further development in daily business (newsletter, website, etc.)
- Working on the continuous development of web design concepts and be responsible for the conception and implementation of new materials
Ideally you:
- Have a passion for brand design and a love for new challenges
- Are an excellent visual storyteller / conceptual thinker
- Have great communication skills
- Want to work in and shape a world-class team
- Are organized, open, process-oriented and a team player with excellent English skills
- Are in or are willing to move to Berlin
**The Process**
Please submit your CV for review. The first step will be a screening call with a member of our operations team to settle some basic questions and details. Further stages will be a meeting with various members of the team and the founder, Simon Harman. 
This is a key hire, so we are willing to move quickly for the right person. If you have any questions about the role you can email [email protected] We look forward to hearing from you and hope that you join us on our journey.

Chainflip is like nothing you will have ever worked on before: it is a multidisciplinary exercise in distributed systems, decentralised finance, blockchain consensus mechanisms, cyber security, applied cryptography, and front end tooling. 
If any of the below tasks seem appealing to you, read on:
Social Media Management (Killing it on Twitter)
Community Management (Hanging out on Telegram)
Content Writing (Reading and writing about Crypto)
Digital Design (Making pretty things and memes)
Market Analysis (Staying on top of crypto trends)
We want our marketing team to be dynamic and to be able to wear many different hats. If you don;t like the sound of typical roles that attempt to shoehorn your talents into one particular direction, look no further: this is a unique project with massive upside potential and a company with experienced founders and great culture. 
The Project
Chainflip enables cross-chain cryptocurrency swapping - like swapping Bitcoin for Ethereum - without using centralised exchanges, specialised wallets, or wrapped tokens. Think of it like Uniswap, but you will always receive the native token.
Existing decentralised token swapping solutions suffer from a range of issues that severely limit usability, privacy, and practicality. Utilising a novel MPC and threshold encryption based system run by its own validator network, Chainflip is a protocol for automated cross-chain token swaps that resolves these issues with a truly decentralised solution.
We are scaling up our experienced team. We’re looking for people who are looking to be a part of a fast growing startup, run by experienced founders and with a solid engineering team and support staff base to help us carry forward the vision we have for the future of permissionless value transfer. 
We’ve spent over 9 months working on the product already, which to date has been developed by our team of experienced engineers that have been working with each other for some years already on other projects as well. As we get closer to launch, we need the help of even more talented people to get to launch and go to market from day one. As we said: Chainflip is like nothing you’ll have ever worked on before. This is a very rare opportunity to work in the crypto industry on a project that goes far beyond your typical project or company. 
If you’re ambitious, experienced, and/or passionate about DeFi we want to hear from you.
The Role
As an early member of the Chainflip team you will have the opportunity to grow within the business and propel your career in an industry that can truly change how we view self-sovereignty and transfer of value. 
As such, we are looking for a passionate cryptocurrency professional that is able to stay on top of trends within the ecosystem, and create highly engaging social media content and activity. 
We need someone that can conduct in-depth research into technical, community, and general market trends - someone that can see how our product and project fits within it, and can use this information to make our channels and community platforms pop. Our marketing team needs to be able to jump between tasks and use an array of skills to do what is required as it is required. 
Chainflip is a rapidly evolving organisation so being a self starter is essential, we work well as a cohesive team but understanding the nuances of a cryptocurrency startup will be a huge bonus. 
Ideally you are already embedded in the DeFi space, maybe you write a blog or are currently a content writer or analyst for a fund, exchange, or project team. If you spend much of your day on Twitter, Medium, and Discord, we want to hear from you. We’re open to applications. Fluent written English is essential though.
Salary range is €36k - 58k, plus equity/tokens
The Process
Please submit your CV and some examples of your writing for review. If we like what we see then you will have an interview with our operations team followed by a final stage with our founder. We reserve the right to add a further stage so you can meet some more of the team.
We have just closed our third funding round so we can move quickly for the right person.

"Principal Engineer / Lead – Core Protocol","Dapper Labs","Full Time","Tech",NA,"Remote",NA,"1963 views",2021-03-11,"https://crypto.jobs/jobs/principal-engineer-lead-core-protocol-at-dapper-labs-1","Dapper Labs is the creator of industry-leading experiences including CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot, as well as Dapper, the simplest way to manage your assets and use the blockchain. We are the original developers behind Flow, a new decentralized blockchain and cryptocurrency designed from the ground up for scalability and ease of use.
Flow is currently fully functional and operating in mainnet, powered by hundreds of nodes distributed around the world, and running several consumer applications including NBA Top Shot. However Flow is a new architecture, and as such there is a long list of known areas of improvement and optimization in the protocol, as well as several open research problems that are keeping our university partners busy.
About the role:
Join an experienced team of humble engineers and architects in a player-coach technical leadership role reporting directly to the CTO (Dieter Shirley). 
Accelerate the growth of our best people, providing mentorship to senior engineers from your direct experience as well as building internal processes so team members help each other grow.
Prioritize and strategize on solving the most critical issues that arise within the Flow protocol, responding to what we learn from our own experiences and those of our community.
Work with the Flow leadership team to operationalize a complex technical roadmap into components that can be tackled independently by empowered teams, parallelizing effort wherever possible (everything from our in-production node software to tackling research problems on the horizon).
[Optional] Engage the Flow community – especially our ecosystem of open source contributors and developer tools-makers – to make sure Flow nurtures the best ecosystem for consumer application developers. 
About Flow:
Flow is a new smart contract blockchain built from the ground up for performance and developer experience – without compromising on decentralization. Instead of networks like Ethereum, where every node in the network performs the same work equally, the Flow architecture allows nodes to specialize based on their hardware capacity as well as their financial stake – dramatically increasing performance while maintaining wide participation. 
Compared to sharding, the Flow architecture means the separation of labor between nodes is vertical (across the different validation stages for each transaction) rather than horizontal (across different transactions). In other words, every node still participates in the validation of every transaction, but they do so only at one of the stages of validation. The result is that Flow is the first decentralized network that can maintain a developer friendly, ACID-compliant execution environment at scale. This is critical for composability: https://a16z.com/2018/12/16/4-eras-of-blockchain-computing-degrees-of-composability
About Dapper Labs:
Our mission at Dapper Labs is to make the world a more open, empowering, and enjoyable place through consumer adoption of decentralized technologies. We have raised over $50M from leading VCs including Fred Wilson (USV) and Chris Dixon as well as Venrock, Samsung, Google Ventures, NBA players, and global artists, among others. Dapper Labs partners include the NBA and NBPA, the NFL-PA, Ubisoft, Warner Music, Turner, Dr. Seuss, Genies, and the UFC, as well as 100+ others. 
Dapper team members are humble and curious builders who share a passion to make the world a more open and empowering place through adoption of decentralized systems. Our people are our greatest strength: our diverse crew flourishes in a distributed hierarchy where personal autonomy and professional growth are encouraged. We value our culture above else: regardless of where you came from, what you studied, or who you used to work for, your role here will necessitate both a high level of creativity and strategic thinking on complex issues.

€50 – 90k + Equity / Tokens
Berlin based or willing to relocate
Chainflip enables cross-chain cryptocurrency swapping - like swapping Bitcoin for Ethereum - without using centralised exchanges, specialised wallets, or wrapped tokens. Think of it like Uniswap, but you will always receive the native token.
Existing decentralised token swapping solutions suffer from a range of issues that severely limit usability, privacy, and practicality. Chainflip is a protocol for automated cross-chain token swaps that resolves these issues with a truly decentralised solution.
We will be dramatically expanding the team over the next 6 months, and we’re looking for people who are looking to be a part of a fast growing early stage team to carry forward the vision we have for the future of permissionless value transfer. 
You’ll be joining an experienced founder along with an existing engineering team and ongoing support from another major project. We’re an early stage venture but we already have momentum, funding and, most importantly, a plan.
If you’re ambitious, experienced, and passionate about DeFi we want to hear from you.
The Role
As an early member of the Chainflip team you will have the opportunity to grow within the business and propel your career in an industry that can truly change how we view self-sovereignty and transfer of value. 
Much of our backend technology stack relies heavily on our own Rust based software which includes p2p networking, consensus mechanisms, blockchain technology, and cryptography.
We are now looking for an experienced Full Stack Engineer to join our high performing Berlin based team. You will be the glue that works closely with our Rust and Substrate Engineers with a slight focus on Front End development and auxiliary tooling.
You should be well versed in building high traffic, low latency web applications that are capable of processing a large number of transactions simultaneously. You will need to be incredibly proficient with JavaScript, we’ll likely favour Node on the backend and React on the front end, and you should have a good working knowledge of Rust as well.
Further to this, skills in web infrastructure deployment are invaluable to the project. Any DevOps or cloud infrastructure engineering and security skills will go a long way in your application.
Although a challenging task, our existing engineering team of seven are capable of delivering the product, but with additional experienced engineers working alongside them, we will be able to achieve much more in a shorter time frame. As an early employee to Chainflip you have an amazing opportunity to help steer the direction of our toolset and software, and also the scope of what we are building.
Salary range is €50k - 90k, plus equity/tokens
The Process
Please submit your CV for review. For our engineering or technical roles, the first stage is a 1hr remote code interview run by our existing engineering team in a language of your choice. Following this you will have a more informal meeting with some other members of the team.
This is a key hire, so we are willing to move quickly for the right person.
We look forward to hearing from you and hope that you join us on our journey.","Node, JavaScript, React, AWS, GCP, Rust","

Chainflip is a rapidly evolving organisation so being a self starter is essential, we work well as a cohesive team but understanding the nuances of a cryptocurrency startup will be a huge bonus. 
Ideally you are already embedded in the DeFi space, maybe you write a blog or are currently a content writer or analyst for a fund, exchange, or project team.

"Blockchain Investigator","CipherBlade","Full Time","Analyst",NA,"Remote",NA,"2496 views",2021-02-19,"https://crypto.jobs/jobs/blockchain-investigator-at-cipherblade","CipherBlade continues to grow, and in the past few months has seen unprecedented growth. As we had predicted, a bull market would usher in a new wave of new cryptocurrency users -- and, unfortunately, fraud. As cryptocurrencies become more widely-adopted, there is a continuing demand not just for scam and hack investigations, but expert services -- as two examples, in compliance advisory or as experts for attorneys. (Divorce attorneys love us!)
We’re looking to hire two rockstars for full-time roles as Investigators. This is a demanding and fulfilling role that touches an array of functional areas:
Inbound lead response: CipherBlade has become known as “the 911 for cryptocurrency scam/hack victims.” We average between 75 and 100 inquiries per week over the past month. There is far more demand than supply and we’re highly selective of which cases we take. Being able to ask the right questions of affected parties is a critical step in this process.
Blockchain analysis: CipherBlade is most well known for blockchain analysis. We use tools from multiple providers and develop some of our own tools in-house.
Case management: You will be expected to be responsible for all facts of case management for assigned cases. This includes communicating with the client, managing data (to include files relevant to reports), communicating with law enforcement, exchanges, and counsel, and maintaining meticulous records.
Expert testimony: A core focus of CipherBlade is providing expert services to law firms. This role includes writing of expert reports, attending hearings, and other items associated with expert witness work. (Due to the pandemic, this rarely requires travel. However, do expect to travel once or twice per year for 2-4 days for planning purposes.)
Applicants must:
Have an exceptional command of the English language. While native speakers are not required, command of the English language is critical for interfacing with the people we do collaborate with in our investigations.
Be able to articulate themselves extremely well, both verbally and in written reports. If you are not comfortable speaking in a public setting, or if you are skittish about disagreeing with someone, this is probably not the role for you.
A fundamental understanding of basic money laundering terminology and concepts, such as layering, structuring, etc
Have strong fundamental knowledge of blockchain technology. Bottom line, if you’d flunk a course like Certified Bitcoin Professional, you’re not going to be a good fit here. We’re happy to train you on stuff most people would have no opportunity to get experience with (such as blockchain analysis), but if you don’t know what a UTXO is, this is not the role for you. (Sadly, because of the state of the blockchain industry, this needs to be said: “trader”, “investor,” and “evangelist” are not roles or relevant experience.)
To the theme of the above, if you can’t distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate projects, you won’t be a good fit. (HEX-holder applications will be promptly forwarded to McDonald’s).
Be a responsible self-starter that can work with minimal supervision. Like many other blockchain companies, we did remote work before it was cool. Commutes are inefficient and our clients are all over the world. If you need to be in an office with a manager to perform work, this is not the role for you. You will be expected to manage your caseload. Candidates must have experience in triaging competing priorities.
Be highly trainable. We don’t care about your college degree and don’t care about almost any certification -- no external training exists for our niche. If you’re hungry to learn, you’ll fit in well. The process of self-development does not end with your training: CipherBlade staff continually research and hone their skills.
Be able to responsibly manage all requirements for assigned cases, and coordinate with the rest of the team for coverage gaps. CipherBlade regularly monitors addresses containing stolen cryptocurrency with real-time notifications. We do not expect, nor do we want, any of our staff to work excessively long days. There may be the once or twice a year circumstance where you need to get out of bed at an uncomfortable time due to transaction notifications that require timely action for exchange intercepts; while this is very rare due to our internationally dispersed team, people do go on vacations and take time off here (we’re very adamant about work-life balance) and we need to find candidates that we can trust should they say “I’ve got the watch.”
Be generally tech-savvy. This should go without saying, considering what was mentioned about baseline Bitcoin knowledge, but it needs to be reiterated. If simple applications and tools such as Slack defeat you, this is not the role for you. (It’s 2021 and we’re a year into a pandemic: having “experienced with Microsoft Office” was something that might’ve been impressive on a resume 20 years ago, and is now just expected.)
Be able to “break it down Barney style”. Within the same hour, a CipherBlade employee might do something highly-complex, such as perform advanced analysis on mixers, and then, for a different case, guide a client through how to export transactions from a cryptocurrency exchange account. We have had cases where Courts and law enforcement had never even heard of Bitcoin -- you must be able to “explain like I’m five” basic concepts regarding cryptocurrencies.
Have strong knowledge of personal-level cybersecurity, particularly for cryptocurrency exchange accounts and “gateway” accounts such as email accounts. Additionally, strong knowledge of cryptocurrency self-custody, and to combine the two, credential management, is a must. If you’re not familiar with 2FA, VoIPs, and baseline security measures, you’re not fit to hold cryptocurrency let alone be considered an applicant with our firm. Almost every cryptocurrency hack we’ve reviewed could have been easily prevented by just one of the numerous security measures described in the linked post.
Want to make the world a better place. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have immense potential, yet the societal learning curve for transitioning from centralized protections to self-custody has and will continue to result in fraud. Opportunistic criminals will always exist, and CipherBlade was born to combat them. In addition to investigating cryptocurrency crooks, we try to spend some time educating the public via blog posts, participating in panels/events, and trying to excite people by empowering them: we love to show how preventable most cryptocurrency theft is and consistently state that we’ll know our industry has matured when more people contact us before the fact (for preventative security) than after (for investigations). We’re part of Crypto Defender’s Alliance, where we actively mitigate ongoing stolen asset movements with exchange partners, as well as the Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative where we provide blockchain analysis for human trafficking and child exploitation cases.
Be willing to consent to a thorough background check. CipherBlade handles an array of cases, all of which include confidential information, and many of which include highly sensitive information. 
Have a good sense of humor. In CipherBlade, we work hard and play hard. You will get memed. You will meme others. If you can’t handle R-rated movies, this won’t be a good fit. 
Have exceptional integrity. We have a no tolerance policy on this. This zero tolerance stance also applies to any form of prejudice. We employ and work with people from all walks of life.
Extremely well qualified candidates might have some of the following:
Chainalysis Reactor Certification: As Chainalysis Reactor is our primary investigative tool, being well-acquainted with Chainalysis Reactor puts you far ahead of other candidates. (Due to the fact that there are no other certifications that are strongly relevant to what we do, and that most CRC certificate holders are certified by their existing employers, this is not a must; this training will be compulsory and paid for candidates we select if they do not have it.)
Experience testifying.
Experience as a law enforcement professional.
Bonus points if…
You are fluent in additional languages.
You have experience in OSINT.
You have experience in “traditional” digital forensics
Priority 1: You reside in Australia, South Korea, or Japan as a matter of priority over subsequently named countries. 
Priority 2: You reside in the US, UK, or Canada 
You have (or at least had) a security clearance.
You have prior experience in a relevant investigative role (retail theft is not relevant, but cyber investigations is).
You have prior experience in a relevant compliance role (bank compliance is at best nominally beneficial, but if you’ve worked in a compliance role for a crypto business, that is something noteworthy to us).
You have prior experience in the legal realm
You include a writing sample (such as a report or blog post) with your application. We don’t believe in ancient hiring practices, such as requiring cover letters (“because everyone else is”), but show us what you’ve got if you want to stand out from the crowd.
You are a military veteran. While this, in and of itself, won’t get you hired (as there are hundreds of jobs one could do in the military, and most won’t be relevant in terms of hard-skills), it will make you stand out a bit more -- veterans need missions and we’ve got endless missions. 
What’s in it for you?
Generous compensation in fiat or crypto!
Experience working in the only company providing this array of services. There is no certification nor training course that replicates what we train our new hires on nor the experience our staff gets in their first few assignments.
The satisfaction of helping people obtain the outcomes they deserve through truth in blockchains. “People lie, blockchains don’t” will become your earned ethos.","Investigations, AML, Fraud, Compliance, Legal","

"Blockchain Lead","Fractal Protocol","Full Time","Tech",NA,"Remote","Germany","1373 views",2021-02-17,"https://crypto.jobs/jobs/blockchain-lead-at-fractal-protocol-1","I'm the CTO at Fractal, looking for a Blockchain Lead: a strong right arm for our new blockchain venture. Someone to come deep into the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem, help me with research, and shape the product's technical direction. Someone to help me hire and coordinate internal and external resources to imagine, design and build a better Web. Let me explain what I mean.
We're a tight, passionate team who moves fast and gets things done. We started Fractal in 2017, and our first product was Fractal Launchpad — a crowdfunding platform where blockchain projects such as the Ocean Protocol raised funds from the community.
Fractal ID, our current product, is a federated identity system (think ""log in with Facebook"", but with verified users). It collects and verifies user identities according to the compliance needs of our clients (blockchain fintechs). Because these identities are reusable, we deliver fast frustration-free onboarding for users and high conversion rates for clients.
We're now starting to build the Fractal Protocol. It is an open source protocol designed to rebalance the online advertising market. This market used to fund a free and open Web — critical for democracy and inclusion — but has fallen into the hands of a rent-seeking oligopoly. We believe we can build a new equilibrium that respects user privacy, protects advertisers from fraud and rewards content creators. This is because we finally have the technology to get it done. Blockchain provides a trustless, shared source of truth for mechanism design. Zero-knowledge proofs and differential privacy help keep users safe. Decentralized identity and verifiable credentials brings people self-sovereignty over their own data.
I know that my ideal candidate would be hard to find, and it's ok that some of these don't describe you: a solid Rust engineer with good working knowledge of the fundamentals of blockchain technology.

------
We are a rapidly growing organization with an overwhelming demand for our unique expertise. We are looking for an experienced consultant to help manage our client engagements and support Project Leads in developing core blockchain solutions, liaising with clients, outlining deliverables, coordinating the internal team to ensure timely completion, and managing the day-to-day realities of our projects from inception to conclusion.
This individual will work closely with the CEO, Director of Research, and Project Leads to start managing client engagements. This is a client-facing and internal coordination role, with both opportunities and expectations to contribute immediately.
Deep blockchain expertise is a differentiator but not required, though the ability to learn new industries and technologies will be critical for starting to lead engagements and contributing intellectually to all facets of our work. This is an opportunity for an individual with strong base consulting skills to work alongside people who have researched this technology and designed economies since 2013. We are confident we can help the right person learn quickly while relying on them to expand our client engagement capabilities.
Core Responsibilities:
- Manage consulting engagements for clients around the world and in many different industries
- Serve as the day-to-day point of contact with clients
- Based on client needs, help define the necessary deliverables and manage the process for completing them. Developing the blockchain content itself is not required but ensuring both Analysts and Project Leads complete required parts is critical.
- Draft scopes of work and keep client expectations aligned with them
- Mentor internal Research Analysts on being a strong consultant
- Serve as peer review for technical work, such as Excel-based token models and architecture diagrams. Expertise not required, but critical thinking is essential
- Learn the basics of cryptoeconomic design, incentive design, and both the permissioned and public blockchain industries
- Help develop new cryptoeconomic mechanisms, systems, and analytical models
- Eventually, source new projects and clients
- Eventually, comfortably handle initial client conversations independently
- Use internal software suite to coordinate with the team
- Note: the majority of the team is based in Pacific Standard Time or Eastern Standard Time. While candidates from all locations around the world will be considered, it will be expected that candidates can comfortably liaise with staff and clients during a significant portion of US business hours
Requirements:
- 3 - 5+ years of experience in a consulting role, ideally management consulting, with client-facing responsibilities and experience managing analysts
- Familiarity with multiple industries and basic concepts in economics, finance, and technology
- Experience with Microsoft Excel, with Python/R experience as a differentiator
- Ability to learn quickly (and enthusiastically): the amount of learning required in this space cannot be overstated
- Uphold cultural values of integrity and independence
- Independently driven - this role has high expectations for autonomy and responsibility
- Blockchain knowledge, experience, and networks are not required but will be strong differentiators. Belief in the potential of blockchain technology—ideally with a sober appreciation of current and future challenges—is a must for having this job be enjoyable!
Note: Our organization has transferred to a distributed structure, and as such this role will be remote.
We are looking for a detail-obsessed and strategically minded individual to help us scale our consulting impact and team. This job will have no shortage of challenges, but we can promise a front row seat to the most exciting and interesting research being done today. Our projects are never simple, and they are certainly never boring.
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity in our organization. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Boson Protocol is advancing the world of commerce by enabling enterprises, organisations, and customers to bridge the divide between digital decentralized technologies and the transfer and trade of physical goods. 
Our vision is for Boson to become the basic plumbing for dCommerce, where the captured value is distributed equitably between stakeholders and protected from capture by a single centralized entity.
The project aims at implementing this vision primarily by tokenizing future commitments to transact, using stateful NFT vouchers, governed by a novel game-theory-based exchange mechanism.

At a minimum it will have the following roles: Streamlining the core exchange mechanism, incentivizing demand and supply acquisition, coordinating data sharing, powering NFT voucher curation and incentivising relayers.

Through our token sale platform, we've helped projects like Filecoin, Blockstack, and Origin raise over $450 million. Through our community building tools, we've helped projects like DFINITY and 0x engage developers and crypto enthusiasts. We are backed by top-tier investors, have offices in SF and NY, and are just getting started.
We’ve built our reputation on trust, compliance, and reliability, and security is key to that reputation. As the Lead Application Security Engineer at CoinList, you’ll be building security in a challenging space, on increasingly risky and exciting products, at a company that will deeply appreciate your work (not just pay attention when things go wrong).
If you are an entrepreneurial and hands-on security leader with exceptional talent, we’d love to hear from you.
Who you are
You’re an engineer at heart. You're a skilled coder who likes to build things, and you probably spent most of your time as an engineer before shifting your focus towards security engineering.
You’re comfortable with complexity. Delivering a simple experience to our users sometimes means managing large and intricate systems behind the scenes.
You love security. You read about this stuff on nights and weekends. You hack in your spare time.
You’re interested in crypto. Preferably you’ve built things in it. At a minimum, you have a desire to learn.
You’re curious. You want to understand how things work. You value interesting things, especially outside your discipline. You like teaching others and constantly learning. You read and question things.
You like to ship. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don’t. People know they can count on you to get things done.
You’re scrappy and entrepreneurial. You’ve built apps for fun and worked on side projects before. If you haven’t already started your own company, you think you might like to in the future.
What you will do
You will lead all aspects of our security operations. From our 2FA system, to our operational and regulatory needs, to complex systems unique to the crypto world (e.g., custody), security at CoinList is a serious matter. As the Lead Application Security Engineer, you will be in charge of defining every detail, building out the team, and making sure our entire system remains secure and compliant as we continue to scale.
You will architect and audit. You’ll design systems from the ground up, and constantly push them. You’ll review code, infrastructure, and processes to spot weaknesses, and you’ll implement robust and pragmatic solutions to those that you find.
You’ll be an owner. We believe in hiring smart people and giving them as much responsibility as they can handle. Whether it’s running a new project, talking with regulators to help inform policy decisions, or leading our negotiation with a new partner, we’ll make sure you are always pushing yourself to new levels.
You’ll create the future. Crypto is a far bigger deal than most people realize, and at CoinList you will be be at the forefront of it. There are all sorts of technical challenges you’ll be working though and new questions you’ll have to answer, in partnership with founders for the leading crypto projects across the globe. If you’re successful, you’ll build something the world has never before seen.
As an early employee at CoinList you will be a critical part of our core team and have a huge influence over the direction of the company. We will compensate you well, invest deeply in your development, and do everything we can to make sure this is the single best work experience of your life.","security expert / software engineer","

- Sketch and define a product roadmap to ship the vision, strategy, design, and execution of a two sided platform to support a thriving user-developer ecosystem.
- Plan and build products that serve our developer community using best practices to increase user adoption, inform content creator workflow, and build an exceptional user experience.
- Plan and build products and features that dramatically lower the barriers of blockchain accessibility for normal people all over the world.
- Plan and build products and features that create compelling decentralized value for normal people all over the world.
A little about you:
- You can apply your skills across a variety of use cases.
- We believe in processes and the power of planning, but you will often have to roll with the punches and prioritize the most impactful tasks on the fly.
- Ideal candidates will have proven experience building and leading world-class teams, navigating complex strategic landscapes, and setting a culture for product quality that runs through every facet of their work.
- Our hierarchy is very flexible, so while we prefer you to build a team, we are fine with strong individual contributors, especially if you have a rare specialty. We prefer full-time in Vancouver but are open to remote candidates and contractors.
- You’ve built tools or products serving games (major bonus points here). You have technical know-how and an engineering background, so you can speak developer’s’ language. We work in a highly technical space so fluency is expected, but we don’t need you to be a blockchain expert – we can get you there.
- Experience in gaming is a bonus but not required – we would equally value familiarity with payments, consumer and/or social platforms, and/or cryptocurrency.
- Making product roadmaps gets you out of bed in the morning. 
- Balancing resource constraints with a burning desire to build magnificent software in a complex and evolving landscape is your ideas of a good time.
- You still argue about Yo!, have strong opinions on Secret and were perhaps obsessed with Stolen.
- Mentoring brilliant young product minds warms your heart, already frigid from years of high stress product development.

"Marketing","Bitcoin Enhanced","Other","Marketing",NA,"Remote",NA,"4572 views",2018-05-10,"https://crypto.jobs/jobs/marketing-at-bitcoin-enhanced","About Bitcoin Enhanced
Bitcoin Enhanced is a crypto-currency that enhances the value of Bitcoin by forecasting when its price is likely to fall. If you believe in Bitcoin then Bitcoin Enhanced offers you the possibility of significantly better returns.
The coin tracks the price of Bitcoin except when it forecasts the price is likely to fall. If the forecast is correct and the price of Bitcoin falls, the price of Bitcoin Enhanced coins goes up by the corresponding amount. At the end of the forecast period Bitcoin Enhanced again tracks the percentage price changes in Bitcoin, but now with a multiplier based on the successful/non-successful outcome of the forecast.
In other words Bitcoin Enhanced uses the volatility of Bitcoin to improve prices. 
Because of Bitcoin’s rapid growth the compounding effect of successful forecasts is staggering. For example on 13th September 2013 $5.93 would have bought you one Bitcoin. By 14th February 2018 the value of your coin had risen to $9,071, an average annual increase of 237%. Not a bad investment. However during the same period the value of a Bitcoin Enhanced coin would have risen to $136,741, an average annual increase of 21,265%. In this simulation Bitcoin Enhanced improved the value of Bitcoin by a multiple of 15.
Because Bitcoin Enhanced is essentially a derivative of Bitcoin, there will be no ICO or Air Drop or other mechanism that could dilute the coin’s value. From day one we are committed to provide full value to holders of the coin. 
Like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Enhanced is decentralised and open sourced. There is no corporate structure, CEO or VC funds. As the community grows it will take over the running of the coin.
99% of revenue from the sale of the coins is invested into humanitarian projects that, like Bitcoin, have the potential to make a profound impact on the wellbeing of humanity and the planet. 
Your Profile
You probably do not need to work but you believe in Bitcoin and the power it has to change the very fabric of society. You want to be involved in the next “big thing” and are looking for a channel for your passion and creativity. You have probably already have made a significant contribution to the crypto-world and personally know many of the key shakers and movers. You are driven by you values and want to contribute to positive change.
The Role
To successfully launch Bitcoin Enhanced as the next level of prosperity for believers in Bitcoin. The way you do this is up to you. However it will probably include building a community following for the coin and drawing in leading figures from the crypto-world that like you believe in the transformation that Bitcoin is making to people’s lives. 
You understand how to inspire others and galvanise them into raising the profile of Bitcoin Enhanced. You lucidly articulate your conviction that Bitcoin Enhanced is the coin to hold both for capital gain and to further the goal of a society based upon decentralisation and the blockchain. 
You are most comfortable working remotely and have the courage to follow your convictions to achieve your goals.
Remuneration
Contributors are paid in BE coins. The starting salary for everyone is 0.5 coins a month, currently equal to around $5,500. The number of coins offered increases according to the value of their contribution to the project.
Please be aware that if the project does not succeed, Contributors will have given time, creativity and energy into the project for no return. Before joining Bitcoin Enhanced you must be sure that this worst case scenario is acceptable to you.
The coins will be issued to Contributors once 100,000 coins have been sold. Before then each contributor receives a monthly statement of coins earned. The statement is encrypted, time stamped and published on the Ethereum blockchain as proof of reward.
Example:
Rachael has been working with Bitcoin Enhanced for 5 months. She is on a salary of 0.5 coins a month. 
At the end of the month, Bitcoin Enhanced issues Rachael with her statement of account. The statement is encrypted, time stamped and published on the Ethereum blockchain. Rachael is given the password and link to the record. 
It reads:
“On behalf of Bitcoin Enhanced, we confirm the balance of Rachael Carson’s account as 2.5 coins at 30th June 2018. Rachael’s current salary is 0.5 coins a month. Coins will be issued once 100,000 coins have been sold. Signed: Jose Baker on behalf of Bitcoin Enhanced.”","communication, on-line marketing, community building, business development","

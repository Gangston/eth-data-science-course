## It's So Shiny!

Shiny is an R package that allows you to easily create interactive web applets using R.

  - Produced by RStudio.
  - Code can be entirely within R (or customized with HTML/Javascript).
  - Take a look at Rstudio's [showcase](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) of shiny applets.
